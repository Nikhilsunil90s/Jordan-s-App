Online Shopping App.

The project is build to provide an Online Commodity shopping platform.

This web application is build using HTML, CSS, JavaScript including some other frameworks of JavaScript like JQuery and Bootstrap.

These web building frameworks were chosen based on the latest market and web trends. 

Once the platform is chosen, the first step is to design a structure of a webpage using HTML. 

HTML puts the things in place and an overall layout of a page is created.

The page is then beautified using Cascading Style Sheets or simply, CSS. 

The CSS works to highlight important things on a page. It can add colors to an HTML element, make them look more appealing and attractive.

The navigational bar on the top, the styled buttons, the images all are seen on our website using CSS. Also, their layout and way of displaying them also depends upon CSS.

In few pages, such as a page to display a list of available commodities, special effects of CSS are used, namely, Carousel. This effect
gives our page a sliding look and feel. We can slide our items right to left to see new items. 

In our checkout pages, the forms are also modified using CSS classes.

The CSS makes a webpage look more meaningful and relateable but yet, the page is static. 

To make a page dynamic, JavaScript is added to the code.

The JavaScript code can work on any page to make it responsive to the user. We add our JavaScript code on pages like Checkout, Cart page and the Delivery pages. 

The JavaScript code can fetch the values from a form and send it for further usage.
